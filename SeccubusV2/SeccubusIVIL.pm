=head1 IVIL - Functions to import IVIL

=head2 load_ivil

This function will parse valid IVIL content and load the findings from it in 
the Seccubus database.

=over 2

=item Parameters

=over 4

=item ivil		- the IVIL content, this can either be a variable 
			  containing the IVIL text itself or the path to a file
			  containing the IVIL text

=item scanner		- (Optional) The name of the scanner to be used, if not value is given the value will be read from IVIL 

=item scanner_ver	- (Optional) Version of the scanner, if no value is given the value will be read from IVIL

=item timestamp		- (Optional) Timestamp of the scan in the format YYYYMMDDHHmmss, if no value is given the value will be read from ivil

=item workspace		- (Optional) Name of the workspace to load the findings into, if no value is given the value will be read from ivil. If the workspace does not exist, it will be created.

=item scan		- (Optional) Name of the scan to load the findings into, if not value is given the the value will be read from IVIL. If no value can be read, this defaults to the workspace name. If the scan does not exist it will be created.

=item print		- (Optional) Print progress to stdin

=back

=item Checks

Permission checks are performed by the individual workspace, scan and findings
routines. XML::Simple checks for valid XML syntax

=back

=item Returns

workspace_id	- ID of the workspace the vulnerabilities were loaded into
scan_id		- ID of the scan the vulnerabilities were loaded into
run_id		- ID of the run that was created for this scan
