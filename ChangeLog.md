Seccubus V2 Change Log
======================

Seccubus automates regular vulnerability scans with vrious tools and aids
security people in the fast analysis of its output, both on the first scan and
on repeated scans.

On repeated scan delta reporting ensures that findings only need to be judged
when they first appear in the scan results or when their output changes.

This code is the only actively developed and maintained branch and all support
for Seccubus V1 has officially been dropped.

Seccubus V2 works with the following scanners:
* Nessus
* OpenVAS
* Skipfish
* Medusa (local and remote)
* Nikto (local and remote)
* NMap (local and remote)
* OWASP-ZAP (local and remote)
* SSLyze
* Medusa
* Qualys SSL labs
* testssl.sh (local and remote)

* Fixed git complaining about unrelated histories

15-9-2017 - v2.40 - Fixes and improvements
==========================================

This release mainly fixes installation issues on Debian and issue in docker that are due to the PERL5LIB path
that doesn't include the current directory anymore.
It also fixes the issue where people were unable to connect to a Nessus instance with a self signed certificate
that was trigged by altered behaviour of a perl library.
I've also fixed and tweaked the user interface a bit.

29-6-2017 - v2.36 - TestSSL.sh release
======================================

This release has been in the making for a long time. In fact the first pull
request for it's main feature was back in June 2016 by our friend and then
colleague Glenn ten Cate.

This release marks the integration of Dirk Wetter's excellent tool testssl.sh
into Seccubus. With testssl.sh you can get a detailed overview of how well
your TLS enabled service is set up. Not just for websites, but for any TCP
service, even those that use STARTTLS.

In addition we introduced the --cdn switch for ssllabs, to reduce noise for
CDN enabled sites, we the ability to dynamically create users via JIT
provisionsing and we added CSRF protection for enhanced security.

To boost future code quality, Perl::Critic testing has been integrated in the
unit testing process.

Besides that we squased some bugs, five of which got introduced in the previous release :(

Enhancements
------------
#302 - Testssl.sh support for Seccubus
#401 - JIT provisioning of users
#442 - Add --cdn option to ssllabs
* Perl Critic is now part of unit testing. All critique was handled

Bug Fixes
---------
* #132 - We have CSRF protection now. Non-get requests should have content-type application/json.
* #461 - Update button on finding edit screen isn't working properly
* #474 - Some typo/style fixes by Jericho (attrition.org)
* #478 - Conralive should check if cron isn't ignored
* #480 - Editing/showing notifications broken
* #483 - add_user broken
* #484 - Failure to update 1+n scan configuration in Manage Scans (And all other update funtions)

15-6-2017 - v2.34 - Backemnd rewritten in Mojolicious
=====================================================

The Seccubusd backend has been REST-ish ever since release v2.0. This web backend was implemented
via Perl CGI scripts (yes, using CGI.pm). Needless to say something needed to change.

This backend rewrite has been in the making for some time now and we are finally ready to release
it into the wild.

What are the major changes?
* Backend rewritten in [Mojolicious](http://mojolicious.org/)
* Backend API is now REST compliant and located at /api
* There is no need to run an external webserver for Seccubus, it is built into Mojolicious
* Seccubus now has built in user authentication (Defaqult admin password is 'GiveMeVulns!')
* Fixed a lot off old issues
* Unfortunately there is no solid Mojolicious v6/v7 rpms for RedHat/Centos, so we can no longer provide RPMs for those operating systems

Enhancements
------------
* #411 - Ported the backend to Mojolicious and pure REST
* #448 - Allow import and export utility to read config from specific file

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed a weird sorting bug when using Chrome
* #138 - Can't locate SeccubusV2.pm in @INC (you may need to install the SeccubusV2 module)
* #143 - Make RPM so that nginx is supported too
* #171 - column formatting in custom SQL is off
* #190 - XSS in custom SQL query
* #193 - RFE: please add a logout button for additional security
* #263 - SeccubusHelpers.pm contains two unused functions
* #363 - API calls for asset use workspace iso of workspaceId which is the standard
* #384 - Missing SMTP server config should be warning, not error
* #396 - ConfigTest should return non 200 if config is not ok
* #417 - Docker container is not https-enabled by default
* #418 - Docker images lacks proper data management
* #430 - Set correct paths for perl and nikto so that do-scan and nikto can now be run by any user
* #445 - RPM errors
* #457 - Mine attachment not sent correctly
* #465 - JSON::false returns "false" on certain platforms
* #466 - /api/version should not be an authenticated call

18-4-2017 - v2.32 - Added dist tag to RPM filename
==================================================

This release is a fixup release of version 2.30. It fixes two errors in import/export and provides
specific RPMs for el5, el6 and el7 now.

Enhancements
------------

Bug Fixes
---------
#438 - Export failed when a scan did not have any attachments
#440 - Import fails if issue it is linked is older then before
#443 - Added dist tag to RPM filename

13-4-2017 - v2.30 -  Improved delta engine and import and export tools
======================================================================

One of the things that has been lacking for a while were proper workspace export and import tools. This release adds them and fixes another issue that has been on our whishlist for long, better handling of gone findings reappearing.

Now when a finding that was previously marked as gone reappears in a scan the 'status before gone' is taken into account.

When the 'status before gone' was:
* New - The finding will reappear as new
* Changed - The finding will reappear as changed
* Open - The finding will reappear as open, unless the finding text has changed, then it will reappear as changed
* No issue - The finding wil reappear as no issue, unless the finding text has changed, then it will reappear as changed
* MASKED - The finding will stay MASKED

Enhancements
------------
* #126 - Delta engine improved: Beter recovery from GONE findings
* #257 - Import/export tools added
* #408 - Seccubus now refuses to load an ivil file with 0 findings
* #412 - Disabled tofu to enhance Docker support
* #419 - Enable crontab support in docker images
* #423 - Show futureGrade in SSLlabs scan results

Bug Fixes
---------
* #403 - SSLlabs scanner help file was not up to date
* #414 - Mkdir error will no longer appear if entrypoint.sh is run twice
* #426 - Corrections to README.md from Karol Kozakowski merged
* #432 - StaticPkpPolicy not recognized

20-2-2017 - v2.28 - The Docker edition
======================================

For my work at [Schuberg Philis](https://www.schubergphilis.com) we wanted to run Seccubus in Docker
containers. This and inspiration from [Karl Newell](https://hub.docker.com/r/karlnewell/seccubus/)
caused me to add a Dockerfile (and some other files) to Seccubus so that Seccubus can now be
run in a docker container.

In addition I fixed a couple of bugs and changed the ssllabs scanner so it now uses the v3 API endpoint.

## Enhancements
- #361 - arkenoi created a netsparker2ivil tool that allows you to manually import Netsparker scans
- #331 - Now using SSLLabs API v3
- #386 - New SSL labs API output featues incorporporated
- #389 - API endpoint URL has moved to a single function so it can be patched if deployed in a
       three tier architecture
- #392 - Alternative handling of the updateFIndings.pl API
- #397 - Allow seccubus to authenticate via an http request header
- #399 - Create a Docker container for Seccubus

## Bug Fixes
- #364 - auto_gen column was missing from asset_host table
- #358 - Could not get findings when an asset was used for the query
- #360 - Not able to export report in PDF format - This breaks the scan
- #336 - Non-critical RPM errors on CentOS 5
- #376 - Removed 50 host limit in filters as it was counterproductive
- #374 - Fixed Nikto path detection code
- #377 - Hostname filter wasn't working correctly, typed Hostname iso HostName
- #385 - SSLlabs failed because cypher preference order was split out per protocol by SSLlabs now.
- #394 - SSLlabs scanner failed if all enpoints fail and --gradeonly was used

12-7-2016 - 2.26 - Speed improvements and a whole log of bugfixes
=================================================================
This release is especially interesting for those of you that are working with large result sets.
The number of findigns that is returned is now limited to 200 results by default and can be adjusted
up or down.
A lot of the filter logic has been moved from the Perl backend to more intelligent database queries
where caching and other optimalisations techniques prevent timeouts when working with larger result
sets.

Additional improvements are done the rpm packaging and the Nessus6 scanner wich now no longer depends
on certain excotic perl modules.

The number of change records that is created and displayed has been reduced and some other more minor
have been fixed too.

Enhancements
------------
* #128 - Limit the amount of findings that is returned from the back end
* #312 - SSLLabs and Nessus6 scanner no longer depend on perl-REST-Client

* #333 - LWP::UserAgent is missing method delete on RH5 and RH6
* #305 - Finding change records are generated even if a finding did not actually change
* #300 - Editing an issue and updating the severity doesn't work
* #295 - Trigger in notification edit will fall back to previous on re-edit
* #277 - Remove redundant documentation from source tree
* #183 - SSL validation ingore not corretly implemented

22-04-2016 - 2.24 - RPM and cert improvements
=============================================

Not everything went perfect upgrading the build process, so we had to tweak the RPM a little and fix an error in the UpToDate.pl script.

Enhancements
------------
* #310 - Root CA for v2.seccubus.com ([LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) is now pinned for the version check

* #269 - Correct handling of multiple address nodes in NMap XML
* #298 - OpenVAS6: fix scan and import to ivil
* #297 - Port field abused to store port state
* #307 - OpenVAS integration was broken

28-10-2015 - 2.20 - What is the issue?
======================================
This release introduces a major new feature that has been in my head since the beginning of Seccubus version 2: Issues.

An issue is a sort of trouble ticket that allows you to link multiple findings together, in order to help keeping track of the remediation process.
An issues can be linked to multiple findings (e.g. because you have the same finding across different hosts) and at the same time a single finding can be linked to multiple issue (e.g. multiple certificate issues found in a single finding).

If you want to know more about issue, please see the online documentation at [www.seccubus.com]

20-01-2015 - 2.13 - OWASP ZAP Proxy
======================================

Seccubus OWASP ZAP Proxy release

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an experienced pen testers toolbox.

The intergration with Seccubus will make you able to launch the ZAP proxy scanner from the commandline and proccess the results into Seccubus. The default policy will be applicable when the scanner is launched. This can be altered by running the program "normally" with ./zap.sh and adjust the policy in the ZAP Gui

Download the OWASP ZAP Proxy and extract the tar.gz

http://sourceforge.net/projects/zaproxy/files/2.3.1/ZAP_2.3.1_Linux.tar.gz/download

More information about ZAP Proxy can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/Introduction?tm=6

Don't forget you need a Java, Ubuntu example:
 sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless

Below are some authentication options examples for ZAP usage:

ZAP option for authentication with session cookie:
 -o "-C JSESSIONID=KJHSAFKJH34SAFL572LKJ"

ZAP option for Basic Header authentication:
 -o "-A user:pass"

ZAP option for performing Login and authenticate and exclude logout URL:
 -o "--auth-form http://example.org/login --auth-user myuser --auth-pass mypass --auth-verify-url http://example.org/profile -X /logout"
