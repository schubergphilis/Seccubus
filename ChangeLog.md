Seccubus V2 Change Log
======================

Seccubus automates regular vulnerability scans with vrious tools and aids
security people in the fast analysis of its output, both on the first scan and
on repeated scans.

On repeated scan delta reporting ensures that findings only need to be judged
when they first appear in the scan results or when their output changes.

This code is the only actively developed and maintained branch and all support
for Seccubus V1 has officially been dropped.

Seccubus V2 works with the following scanners:
* Nessus 4.x, 5.x 6.x (professional and home feed)
* Skipfish (local and remote)
* OWASP ZAP Proxy (local and remote)
* OpenVAS
* Nikto (local and remote)
* NMap (local and remote)
* SSLyze
* Medusa
* Burp Suite
* Qualys SSL labs

12-7-2016 - 2.26 - Speed improvements and a whole log of bugfixes
=================================================================
This release is especially interesting for those of you that are working with large result sets.
The number of findigns that is returned is now limited to 200 results by default and can be adjusted
up or down.
A lot of the filter logic has been moved from the Perl backend to more intelligent database queries 
where caching and other optimalisations techniques prevent timeouts when working with larger result
sets.

Additional improvements are done the rpm packaging and the Nessus6 scanner wich now no longer depends
on certain excotic perl modules.

The number of change records that is created and displayed has been reduced and some other more minor 
have been fixed too.

Enhancements
------------
* #128 - Limit the amount of findings that is returned from the back end 
* #312 - SSLLabs and Nessus6 scanner no longer depend on perl-REST-Client

* #320 - Nessus6 scanner now downloads PDF and HTML version of report too
* #322 - Removed old scanners: Nessus v5 and earlier, OpenVAS v5 and earlier
* Improved exit codes for the onlyonxday.sh utility

* #333 - LWP::UserAgent is missing method delete on RH5 and RH6
* #305 - Finding change records are generated even if a finding did not actually change
* #300 - Editing an issue and updating the severity doesn't work
* #295 - Trigger in notification edit will fall back to previous on re-edit
* #277 - Remove redundant documentation from source tree
* #183 - SSL validation ingore not corretly implemented

22-04-2016 - 2.24 - RPM and cert improvements
=============================================

Not everything went perfect upgrading the build process, so we had to tweak the RPM a little and fix an error in the UpToDate.pl script.

Enhancements
------------
* #310 - Root CA for v2.seccubus.com ([LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) is now pinned for the version check
* #316 - Clarify create database and grant statement in ConfigTest.pl

Enhancements
------------

* #308 - Rewrote the OpenVAS scan script with the following objectives:

  - Remove dependancy on the omp utility (because I don't have it on my Mac for starters)
  - XML parsing is now done with XML::Simple in stead of manually (which is fragile)
  - Better error handling


Bug Fixes
---------
* #289 - Online version test needs a unit test
* #269 - Correct handling of multiple address nodes in NMap XML
* #298 - OpenVAS6: fix scan and import to ivil 
* #297 - Port field abused to store port state
* #307 - OpenVAS integration was broken

28-10-2015 - 2.20 - What is the issue?
======================================
This release introduces a major new feature that has been in my head since the beginning of Seccubus version 2: Issues.

An issue is a sort of trouble ticket that allows you to link multiple findings together, in order to help keeping track of the remediation process.
An issues can be linked to multiple findings (e.g. because you have the same finding across different hosts) and at the same time a single finding can be linked to multiple issue (e.g. multiple certificate issues found in a single finding).

If you want to know more about issue, please see the online documentation at [www.seccubus.com]

20-01-2015 - 2.13 - OWASP ZAP Proxy
======================================

Seccubus OWASP ZAP Proxy release

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing as well as being a useful addition to an experienced pen testers toolbox. 

The intergration with Seccubus will make you able to launch the ZAP proxy scanner from the commandline and proccess the results into Seccubus. The default policy will be applicable when the scanner is launched. This can be altered by running the program "normally" with ./zap.sh and adjust the policy in the ZAP Gui

Download the OWASP ZAP Proxy and extract the tar.gz

http://sourceforge.net/projects/zaproxy/files/2.3.1/ZAP_2.3.1_Linux.tar.gz/download

More information about ZAP Proxy can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/wiki/Introduction?tm=6

Don't forget you need a Java, Ubuntu example:
 sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless

Below are some authentication options examples for ZAP usage:

ZAP option for authentication with session cookie:
 -o "-C JSESSIONID=KJHSAFKJH34SAFL572LKJ"

ZAP option for Basic Header authentication:
 -o "-A user:pass"

ZAP option for performing Login and authenticate and exclude logout URL:
 -o "--auth-form http://example.org/login --auth-user myuser --auth-pass mypass --auth-verify-url http://example.org/profile -X /logout"
